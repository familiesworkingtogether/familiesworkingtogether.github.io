# About

Thank you for considering me as someone that can assist your child or family in better understanding and managing life’s challenges. It may be difficult for a child to cope with changes early in life such as divorce, location changes, beginning enrollment in a school or trauma in their early developmental stages. My goal is to help your child understand their feelings and thoughts and to learn how to communicate and manage them.

At times this counseling journey might have to be taken by the entire family. My job is also to ensure that parents are comfortable in helping their children or family along this journey. I help adults with parenting skills, managing behavior issues and understanding how to be part of their child’s path through counseling. My goal is also to assist adults in processing their own thoughts and feelings through life’s challenges, inside and outside of their home life. I believe that a parent must not forget themselves and the importance of their mental health which will also allow them to provide the appropriate support to their children.

I believe that a strong therapeutic relationship is key in order for me to help you, your child or family through the counseling process. To gain comfortability that you and I are a good fit or to address any initial concerns, I offer free phone consultations. At **Families Working Together** we are passionate about providing the utmost comfort and support to our clients while helping them navigate the obstacles life presents them with.
