## Qualifications 

I have a Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Fairfield University.  I graduated in 2022 and became a licensed counseling practitioner in the state of Connecticut (license number # 46.898989) in 2024. I am a member of the international honor society of professional counseling, Chi Sigma Iota. I hold certificates in Play Therapy, Art Therapy and I am state-certified in Connecticut as a Sexual Violence Crisis Counselor and Advocate. I have been practicing counseling in the Fairfield County for 5 years.

## Counseling Background

I work with adults and children from ages six to ten. I follow a person-center style as well as focus on family systems to approach individual and family issues respectively. I mainly focus on a combined approach among Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Reality Therapy and Strength based therapy while maintaining cultural awareness with families and individuals. With children I find it very effective to use Play and Art Therapy in combination with these theoretical approaches.

## Session Fees and Length of Service 

Sessions are 50 Minutes long. Cost per session is between $80 to $200. Methods for payment accepted are check or credit card. Insurance plans accepted are: Aetna, Husky, Cigna and Medicaid.

## Use of Diagnosis 

Some health insurance companies will reimburse clients for counseling services and some will not.  In addition, most will require that a diagnosis of a mental-health condition and indicate that you must have an “illness” before they will agree to reimburse you.  Some conditions for which people seek counseling do not qualify for reimbursement.  If a qualifying diagnosis is appropriate in your case, I will inform you of the diagnosis before we submit the diagnosis to the health insurance company.  Any diagnosis made will become part of your permanent insurance records.

## Confidentiality

All of our communication becomes part of the clinical record, which is accessible to you upon request.  I will keep confidential anything you say as part of our counseling relationship, with the following exceptions: (a) you direct me in writing to disclose information to someone else, (b) it is determined you are a danger to yourself or others (including child or elder abuse), or (c) I am ordered by a court to disclose information.
